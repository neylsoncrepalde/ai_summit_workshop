my api has 3 methods. First method is generateCase. 
This method generates a case table based on information provided, that is, client, casename, challenge, 
solution, budget, and kpi. It returns all those properties plus a caseId generated randomly. 
The second method is check case. It takes the caseId string and return all the available information on the case. 
Third is the notify method. It takes the caseId string and returns a message that the user was properly notified.
