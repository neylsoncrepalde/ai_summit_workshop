AWS Financial Services Competency
Service Offering Validation Checklist
January 2024 - 3.0
Self-assessment Spreadsheet
Introduction
The goal of the AWS Specialization Programs is to recognize AWS Partner Network Partners (“AWS Partners”) who demonstrate and maintain technical proficiency
and proven customer success in specialized AWS Partner solution areas. The AWS Competency Partner Validation Checklist (“Checklist”) is intended for AWS Partners
who are interested in applying for an AWS Specialization. This Checklist provides the criteria necessary to achieve the specialization as a consulting partner. AWS Partners undergo a technical validation of their capabilities upon applying for a specific specialization. AWS leverages
in-house expertise and a third-party firm to facilitate the technical validation. AWS reserves the right to make changes to this document at any time and without notice.
Expectation of Parties
It is expected that AWS Partners will review this document in detail before applying for the AWS Competency Program, even if all of the prerequisites are met.
If items in this document are unclear and require further explanation, please contact your AWS Partner Development Representative (“PDR”)
or AWS Partner Development Manager “(PDM”) as the first step. Your PDR/PDM will contact the program office if further assistance is required.
AWS Partners should complete the Self-Assessment Spreadsheet linked at the top of this page, prior to submitting a program application. Once completed, AWS Partners must submit an application in APN Partner Central. Visit the AWS Competency Program guide for step-by-step instructions on how to submit an application.
AWS will review and aim to respond back with any questions within five business days to initiate scheduling of your technical validation or to request additional information.
AWS Partners should prepare for the technical validation by reading the Checklist, completing a self-assessment using the Checklist, and gathering and organizing objective evidence to share with the reviewer on the day of the technical validation.
AWS recommends that AWS Partners have individuals who are able to speak in-depth to the requirements and the customer examples during the technical validation. The best practice is for the AWS Partner to make the following personnel available for the technical validation: one or more highly-technical AWS certified engineers/architects in the area of competency specialty, an operations manager who is responsible for the operations and support elements, and a business development executive to conduct the overview presentation.
AWS may revoke an AWS Partner’s Competency designation if, at any time, AWS determines in its sole discretion that such AWS Partner does not meet its AWS Competency Program requirements.
If an AWS Partner’s AWS Competency designation is revoked, such AWS Partner will (i) no longer receive benefits associated with its designation, (ii) immediately cease use of all materials provided to it in connection with the applicable AWS Competency designation and (ii) immediately cease to identify itself as a member of the AWS Competency.
AWS Partners should ensure that they have the necessary consents to share with the auditor (whether AWS or a third-party) all information contained within the objective evidence or any demonstrations prior to scheduling the audit.
