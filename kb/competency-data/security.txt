Self-assessment Spreadsheet
Introduction
The goal of the AWS Specialization Programs is to recognize AWS Partner Network Partners (“AWS Partners”) who demonstrate and maintain technical proficiency
and proven customer success in specialized AWS Partner solution areas. The AWS Competency Partner Validation Checklist (“Checklist”) is intended for AWS Partners
who are interested in applying for an AWS Specialization. This Checklist provides the criteria necessary to achieve the specialization as a consulting partner. AWS Partners undergo a technical validation of their capabilities upon applying for a specific specialization. AWS leverages
in-house expertise and a third-party firm to facilitate the technical validation. AWS reserves the right to make changes to this document at any time and without notice.
Expectation of Parties
It is expected that AWS Partners will review this document in detail before applying for the AWS Competency Program, even if all of the prerequisites are met.
If items in this document are unclear and require further explanation, please contact your AWS Partner Development Representative (“PDR”)
or AWS Partner Development Manager “(PDM”) as the first step. Your PDR/PDM will contact the program office if further assistance is required.
AWS Partners should complete the Self-Assessment Spreadsheet linked at the top of this page, prior to submitting a program application. Once completed, AWS Partners must submit an application in APN Partner Central. Visit the AWS Competency Program guide for step-by-step instructions on how to submit an application.
AWS will review and aim to respond back with any questions within five business days to initiate scheduling of your technical validation or to request additional information.
AWS Partners should prepare for the technical validation by reading the Checklist, completing a self-assessment using the Checklist, and gathering and organizing objective evidence to share with the reviewer on the day of the technical validation.
AWS recommends that AWS Partners have individuals who are able to speak in-depth to the requirements and the customer examples during the technical validation. The best practice is for the AWS Partner to make the following personnel available for the technical validation: one or more highly-technical AWS certified engineers/architects in the area of competency specialty, an operations manager who is responsible for the operations and support elements, and a business development executive to conduct the overview presentation.
AWS may revoke an AWS Partner’s Competency designation if, at any time, AWS determines in its sole discretion that such AWS Partner does not meet its AWS Competency Program requirements.
If an AWS Partner’s AWS Competency designation is revoked, such AWS Partner will (i) no longer receive benefits associated with its designation, (ii) immediately cease use of all materials provided to it in connection with the applicable AWS Competency designation and (ii) immediately cease to identify itself as a member of the AWS Competency.
AWS Partners should ensure that they have the necessary consents to share with the auditor (whether AWS or a third-party) all information contained within the objective evidence or any demonstrations prior to scheduling the audit.
AWS Security Competency Definition
AWS Security Competency Partners provide deep technical and consulting expertise to help AWS customers adopt, develop, and deploy complex security projects.
Security Consulting Categories
Customers have many different needs when it comes to security, so the Security Consulting Competency categories help customers find the right partner to solve their current set of security challenges. A customer may need their infrastructure designed from the
ground up, they may want automation to help with incident response, or they may want their environment to meet the requirements of an audit regime. In order to properly showcase the best AWS Partner
for specific customer needs, it is important to highlight referenceable areas of strength, depth, and experience.
AWS Security Competency Partners are able to guide customers through all phases of security project development, including the integration of native AWS Security Services, AWS controls, and AWS software partners to meet customer requirements.
Below are the eight categories for Security Consulting Competency. Partners must fulfill all the Security Practice Overview requirements. Additionally, partners are required to choose one or more of the eight categories in the Security Practice Requirements and meet the criteria specified within the selected category/categories.
Identity and Access Management - AWS Partners in this category have a proven track record of helping customers define, enforce, and audit permissions across internal and external services, principals, actions, and resources, including AWS accounts.
Threat Detection and Response - Partners need to demonstrate the ability to spot issues before they impact an account
and act on that knowledge to improve the security posture and reduce the risk profile of their customers.
Infrastructure Protection - AWS Partners showcase their ability to ensure that systems and services within customer
workloads are protected against potential vulnerabilities as well as unintended and unauthorized access. For example, you'll
define 1/ trust boundaries, 2/ system security configuration and maintenance, 3/ operating system authentication and authorizations,
and 4/ other appropriate policy-enforcement points such as web application firewalls and/or API gateways.
Data Protection - Data Protection focuses on understanding sensitive data in a customer environment and creating controls
based on different levels of sensitivity.
Controls include encrypting, categorizing, tracking, and tokenizing sensitive data to
meet compliance with internal, regional, and industry compliance requirements.
Compliance and Privacy - AWS Partners in this category have a proven track record of helping customers build environments
in the cloud that adhere to industry standards, pass internal/external audits regimes, and achieve third party certification.
Application Security - Application Security is focused on helping customers test and protect their code from threats. Protections include: performing code reviews, code scanning, penetration testing, prevention of vulnerabilities exploitation and bot attacks, runtime protection, guidance, and mitigation of findings. AWS Partners also implement secure application environments for customers. Areas where these partner activities help include: finding bugs in code, outlining secure software development practices, advising customers on choosing the appropriate encryption libraries, and assessing the permissions of their S3 Bucket policies.
Perimeter Protection - Partners who help customers implement and manage AWS Shield Advanced to protect AWS resources such
as Elastic IP, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 from application threats
like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting. These partners operate 24/7 Security Operations
Centers (SOC), which support configuring, maintaining, monitoring, and troubleshooting AWS workloads to ensure application availability
and performance.
Core Security - AWS Partners in this category demonstrate broad and deep knowledge across the core categories, which are:
Identity and Access Management, Threat Detection and Response, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, Compliance and Privacy, Application Security categories, and Perimeter Protection. Partners obtaining this category will be provided certification in all of these core categories.

Security Customer Example Requirements
The following requirements apply to each provided customer examples.
Customer Examples
EXMUC-001 - Customer Example Definition
Customer examples can be categorized as:
Public - Public customer examples are published to the Internet and a publicly visible URL is provided to AWS. Public case studies reference the customer by name.
Private - Private customer examples are not published to the Internet or shared outside a limited number of AWS employees who need to validate the application.
Anonymous - Anonymized customer examples are published to the Internet with a publicly visible URL, however the actual customer name may be replaced with an anonymized term such as “top healthcare provider in Europe.”
EXMUC-002 - Customer Example Numbers
There is a minimum of four (4) customer examples required for the security competency. There are two options to meet the four customer examples:
Option A - two (2) private customer examples and two (2) public customer examples
Option B - four public (4) anonymized customer examples
If the AWS Partner is applying for multiple categories then the partner still only needs four (4) customer examples total that meet the above requirements. Additionally, the same customer example may apply in multiple categories as long as they are all a part of the same application. To spread the customer examples there is a minimum of:
Option A - one (1) public and (1) private
Option B - two (2) anonymized
EXMUC-003 - Security-specific customer examples
The Security Competency is intended to identify and promote AWS Partners who help customers secure their AWS Infrastructure and hybrid environments such as on-premise applications. All customer examples must meet these criteria:
Customer examples must have a principal narrative around Security.
They may include non-security tasks, but the narrative must focus on solutions to security challenges.
Each customer example must have three (3) security customizations.
A security customization is a deep level of configuration that requires the partner to create unique content in order to address a customer security challenge and does not include simple tool deployments, quickstarts, or pre-built security libraries. Examples of a customization include: building policies to meet regulatory compliance, creating Lambda remediation scripts for security alerts, building a customized CloudWatch dashboard, designing and deploying a new Organizations hierarchy, implementing key management policies and processes, or developing a custom set of WAF rules.
Customer examples involve a process and people transformation in addition to technical enablement and delivery.
Customer examples must exceed AWS Best Practices in some way as defined by the Security Reference Architecture, the Well Architected Framework, and the Security Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).
Each customer example must contain a short description of how at least five (5) AWS native security controls were leveraged (such as IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch Events, Security Hub, and GuardDuty). List of acceptable AWS native security tools include:
Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CodeGuru
Amazon Cognito
Amazon Fraud Detector
Amazon GuardDuty
Amazon Inspector
Amazon Macie
Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall
AWS Access Analyzer
AWS Audit Manager
AWS Certificate Manager
AWS CloudHSMAWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudWatch Events
AWS Config
AWS Config Rules
AWS Detective
AWS Direct Connect
AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (EDR)
AWS Firewall Manager
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
AWS Lambda for security resources
AWS Network Firewall
AWS Secrets Manager
AWS Security Hub
AWS Shield and Shield Advanced
AWS Single Sign-On
AWS WAF (Web Access Firewall)
EXMUC-004 - Architectural Diagram
AWS Partner must provide an architectural diagram that follows the AWS Best Practices as defined by the Security Reference Architecture(SRA), the Well Architected Framework, and the Security Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).
Where possible, the partner should leverage the SRA diagram as the baseline and highlight which AWS native services are used, non-AWS security tools used, and note any customizations.
AWS CloudFormation is also recommended and can leverage example scripts from the SRA repository.
Please provide the following as evidence:
Customer implementation description and must include an architectural diagram and AWS CloudFormation template, where appropriate.
EXMUC-005 - Security Tooling
AWS Partner must have a playbook and design pattern for standardized security tooling they recommend to customers to meet their security and compliance
needs, including ALL of the following:
AWS Account Security Assessment (Root Credential Storage, S3 Bucket Permissions, IAM Permissions, etc.)
Identity, Access Control, and Federation (Secrets Management, SSO, Privileged User Management, Host/App AuthZ/AuthN)
Web Application Firewall (WAF)
DDoS protection
Firewall and Networking Infrastructure (NGFW, Micro-Segmentation, Security Group Management, Network Analysis/Packet Capture)
Remote Connectivity Infrastructure
Endpoint, Host Security (EDR/EPP) and Container Security
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)
Centralized Logging, Monitoring, and/or SIEM
Proxies and Egress Access
Encryption and Key/Secrets Management of S3, EBS, DynamoDB
Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
If the tool is NOT part of the AWS Security Competency, AWS Partner must provide reasons why the solution was chosen and what mechanisms
they have in place to make sure it meets the standards of the Security Software Competency.
Please provide the following as evidence:
Customer implementation description and must include an architectural diagram and AWS CloudFormation template, where appropriate.
